        "# Choosing NumPy: The Benefits\n",
        "Since you already know Python, you may be asking yourself if you really have to learn a whole new paradigm to do data science. Python’s for loops are awesome! Reading and writing CSV files can be done with traditional code. However, there are some convincing arguments for learning a new paradigm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the top four benefits that NumPy can bring to your code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. More speed: NumPy uses algorithms written in C that complete in nanoseconds rather than seconds.\n",
        "2. Fewer loops: NumPy helps you to reduce loops and keep from getting tangled up in iteration indices.\n",
        "3. Clearer code: Without loops, your code will look more like the equations you’re trying to calculate.\n",
        "4. Better quality: There are thousands of contributors working to keep NumPy fast, friendly, and bug free.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of these benefits, NumPy is the de facto standard for multidimensional arrays in Python data science, and many of the most popular libraries are built on top of it. Learning NumPy is a great way to set down a solid foundation as you expand your knowledge into more specific areas of data science."
